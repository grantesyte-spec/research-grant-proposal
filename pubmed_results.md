**Abstract**: The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between diabetes and pressure ulcer (PU) risk in patients with hip fractures. A total of 8 studies with 22,180 patients were included. The mean PU incidence was 15.1% in group with diabetes compared with 7.5% in the group without diabetes. The summary OR was 1.825 (95% CI: 1.373-2.425). Our meta-analysis indicates that diabetes increases the PU risk in hip fracture patients.

**Abstract**: Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified 2588 patients with T2DM who had developed severe hypoglycemia. The incidence of hip fracture was higher in patients with severe hypoglycemia than without severe hypoglycemia (17.19 vs. 8.83 per 1000 person-years; adjusted HR 1.71, 95% CI = 1.35-2.16). Severe hypoglycemia was associated with a higher risk to develop hip fracture.

**Abstract**: Osteoporosis-related fractures are undertreated. The coalition developed 13 recommendations (7 primary and 6 secondary) strongly supported by the empirical literature. The coalition recommends increased communication with patients regarding fracture risk, mortality and morbidity outcomes, and fracture risk reduction. Risk assessment (including fall history) should occur at regular intervals with referral to physical and/or occupational therapy as appropriate. Oral, intravenous, and subcutaneous pharmacotherapies are efficacious and can reduce risk of future fracture.

**Title**: Accelerated surgery versus standard care in hip fracture (HIP ATTACK): an international, randomised, controlled trial
**PMID**: 32050090
**Authors**: HIP ATTACK Investigators
**Journal**: Lancet, 2020 Feb 29;395(10225):698-708
**DOI**: 10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30058-1
**URL**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32050090/
**Status**: TOPIC✓ AUTHORS✓ YEAR✓ ABSTRACT✓ PMID✓

**Abstract**: Observational studies have suggested that accelerated surgery is associated with improved outcomes in patients with a hip fracture. The HIP ATTACK trial assessed whether accelerated surgery could reduce mortality and major complications. Between March 14, 2014, and May 24, 2019, 2970 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned. Among patients with a hip fracture, accelerated surgery did not significantly lower the risk of mortality or a composite of major complications compared with standard care.

## Research Summary

This PubMed search identified 4 highly relevant studies for the research proposal on nursing care of hip fracture patients with diabetes:

1. **Diabetes as a risk factor**: Wei et al. (2017) demonstrated that diabetes significantly increases pressure ulcer risk in hip fracture patients (OR=1.825), supporting the need for specialized nursing interventions.

2. **Hypoglycemia-fracture relationship**: Hung et al. (2017) showed that severe hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes patients is associated with a 71% higher risk of hip fracture, highlighting the importance of glycemic management.

3. **Secondary prevention guidelines**: Conley et al. (2020) provided comprehensive clinical recommendations for secondary fracture prevention, emphasizing multidisciplinary care and patient education.

4. **Clinical trial evidence**: HIP ATTACK Investigators (2020) conducted a large international RCT providing high-quality evidence on hip fracture management.

These references provide strong scientific foundation for developing a nursing intervention combining Orem's Self-Care Model with the Transtheoretical Model for hip fracture patients with diabetes.
