# Research Grant Proposal Skill

Use this skill to produce Chinese-language nursing grant proposals backed by verified literature from CNKI, PubMed, and Wanfang.

## Required flow

1. CNKI research (5-7)
2. PubMed research (5-7)
3. Wanfang research (5-7)
4. Aggregate to `research_notes.md`
5. Draft final proposal

Total required references: **15-21**.

## Important execution rules

- One tab only
- One database at a time
- Keep same browser target context
- Prefer actionable refs over visual page warnings
