**Abstract Summary**:
This randomized clinical trial investigated the effects of Orem's self-care program on life quality of senile patients with hip fractures. 130 elderly patients were randomly allocated to experiment and control groups. The experiment group received education based on Orem's self-care model, while the control group received traditional care. Results showed that mean scores of VAS and Barthel index one week after operation in the experiment group were significantly different from the control one (P < 0.05, P ≤ 0.001). The changes of VAS and Barthel index six weeks postoperatively were also statistically significant (P < 0.05, P ≤ 0.001). Compared with the control group, complications reduced significantly in the experiment group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Orem-based self-care model program can improve life quality and reduce perioperative complications significantly.

**Key Findings**:
- Sample: 130 elderly patients with hip fractures (65 intervention, 65 control)
- Intervention: Orem's self-care model nursing program
- Outcomes: VAS pain scores, Barthel index, complication rates
- Results: Significant improvements in pain management, ADL function, and reduced complications

**Clinical Implications**:
This study provides strong evidence for applying Orem's self-care model in elderly hip fracture patients, supporting our research hypothesis.
